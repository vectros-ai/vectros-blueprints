## 0.7.0

### Added

- **`agentic-sdlc` gains governed agent memory** (blueprint `1.3.0 → 1.6.0`).
  Alongside the team's shared, curated knowledge (decisions, conventions,
  gotchas, …) — the *crystallized* tier — agents and the humans they work for
  now have a **private** working-memory layer, enforced by the platform rather
  than by application code:
  - **The `memory` record type** — a flexible schema for working memory: `kind`
    (`user`/`feedback`/`project`/`reference`/`observation`), a searchable
    `body`, `area` (the same subsystem vocabulary as the curated types, so one
    filter narrows recall across all content), `agent` (the *role* that wrote
    it — `pm`, `builder`, … — not an instance id), `tags`, a supersede
    `status`, an optional `threadId` (your runtime's conversation/session id,
    for episodic slices), a range-queryable `updatedOn`, and `externalId` as
    the stable slug. It also carries a **`priority`** band (a range-queryable
    number, nullable — `0`/`10`/`20`/`30`) for the always-load pinned set and
    recall ranking, and three graph edges: `supersededBy`/`relatedTo` (self-refs
    for the evolution + see-also trail) and a `sourceRef` provenance string.
    Because `memory` is the highest-volume record, its lookups are kept **lean** —
    only the fields you enumerate deterministically (`kind`, `threadId`,
    `updatedOn` range, `priority` range) are lookup-indexed; `area`/`agent`/
    `status` are `filterable` search metadata (no per-write lookup row), and
    `priority`/`threadId` write a row only when set.
  - **The `member` role** — two unioned clauses: the curated shared KB (read
    *and* semantic recall, type-scoped so recall can never expose anyone's
    memory) and **private memory** (the member's own, isolated by a
    `${{ self.userId }}` data-scope — visible only to them, and both
    hybrid-searchable *and* `rag_ask`-groundable by its owner alone). Enroll a person or
    agent in one step with `vectros join agentic-sdlc --role member`; verify a
    binding with `vectros access explain`. (Team-shared working memory — the same
    `memory` type at a group scope — is a planned addition, deferred while the
    shared-scope ownership axis is finalized.)
  - **The bundled guide and agent orientation prompt** gain agent memory: the
    guide's "Agent memory" section (what belongs in memory, the promotion lifecycle
    private → curated, the "your issue tracker owns status; memory owns context"
    rule, the AND-vs-union access model, the `vectros access explain` check, and the
    context-administrator visibility caveat), and the prompt now lists the `memory`
    type and names the private tier as working memory's first-class home. The
    orientation prompt was also slimmed (~220 → ~120 lines) into an operating layer —
    the recall→act→capture loop plus the query/capture disciplines — that points to
    the guide for the exhaustive field lists, payload shapes, and sync markers rather
    than restating them. Recall guidance now leads with `hybrid_search` +
    natural-language queries (reason over the passages yourself; `rag_ask` is an
    optional, inference-metered layer), correcting the prior keyword-first advice.
- **Blueprint format: `accessProfile.identityOverrides` and seed `scopes`.** An
  `accessProfile` may declare identity overrides — the scope values its key
  stamps onto everything it writes — and a seed may declare its `scopes`
  ownership (`[]` = a private, user-owned item). `${{ identities.* }}` tokens
  substitute in both at apply time; `bootstrap` and `blueprint-test` apply them.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **`agentic-sdlc` service key now includes `documents:u`** (blueprint `1.2.0 → 1.3.0`).
  The bootstrapped service-principal `accessProfile` was missing `documents:u`, so the
  agent key could create documents but could neither archive them (a reversible
  `ARCHIVED` status flip — the document-surface analog of the `records:u` supersede it
  already does) nor re-ingest a changed document body (`document_ingest` with `upsert`,
  the repo↔KB sync primitive the bundled guide documents). The whole KB-sync story was
  therefore unexecutable by the very key the blueprint provisions. `documents:u` is now
  in the base data-plane set. Hard delete (`documents:d`) remains deliberately absent
  from the service key — it stays on the human `editor` role — so an archived document
  is always restorable and a compromised key can never purge the knowledge base.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`agentic-sdlc` `editor` role now carries full data-plane delete** (blueprint `1.1.0 → 1.2.0`).
  The human owner's `editor` role gains `records:d` / `documents:d` / `folders:d` on top of the
  shared data-plane actions — so a person granted `editor` can hard-delete data-plane content
  (curation cleanup), while the agent's service key stays delete-free and curates by soft-retract
  (archive) instead. Deleting only *your own* data via a scoped credential is a separate, later
  capability; today `editor` is context-wide.
- **Guide + agent prompt now include KB query-mechanics guidance.** Reach for `record_query`
  before `hybrid_search` for an enumerable ask (exact + compact); query compactly by default
  (`limit: 3` + `uniqueDocuments: true`, since hits carry passages); how to scope by type per
  tool (`hybrid_search` uses `typeName`, which narrows documents and records alike;
  `record_query` uses `type`); and the `textMode: PHRASE` keyword-leg trap on long natural-language queries
  (a `textScore` of 0 on every hit means the keyword leg contributed nothing — use a short
  phrase or `textMode: "OR"`).
- **`agentic-sdlc` records now carry a `sourceRef` field** (blueprint `1.0.0 → 1.1.0`).
  The four record types (`control`, `convention`, `gotcha`, `term`) gain a `sourceRef` string —
  the repo path of the source file each record was distilled from — as an equality
  lookup. It is the record analog of the provenance a document keeps: because many
  records are extracted from one file, a record can't embed an in-file back-reference,
  so it names its source instead. A change to a source file then finds exactly its
  records (`record_query` by `sourceRef`) to re-extract, keeping the knowledge base in
  sync with the repository without a separate index to maintain. Additive and
  backward-compatible; existing records simply have no `sourceRef` until re-extracted.
- **Guide + agent prompt now document the repo↔KB sync pattern in full** — the two
  self-describing markers (`vectros-kb-id` for a file that *is* a KB document,
  `vectros-kb-records` for a file that *feeds* records) plus `sourceRef`, so a consumer
  can keep a mirrored repo and its KB in sync with no side index.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`agentic-sdlc` now declares an `editor` role for the human owner.** `bootstrap`
  provisions a scoped key for your *agent*, but doesn't join *you* — so a blueprint's
  context doesn't appear in the data-plane app until your own user is granted access
  there. The blueprint now ships a reusable `editor` role at **parity with the service
  key** (`records:r/c/u`, `search:r`, `schemas:r`, `inference:r`, `documents:r/c`,
  `folders:r/c`; no delete, no control-plane), which `bootstrap` creates in the context.
  Bind it to your user once to browse and curate the KB in the app:
  `vectros access grant --principal usr_<your-user-id> --context agentic-sdlc --role editor`
  (or via the admin app's Access → Contexts → Profiles). The guide and walkthrough
  document the one-time join, and the package README now documents the top-level
  `roles` format field (previously undocumented — no bundled blueprint used it).

## 0.6.2 — 2026-06-29

### Changed

- **`agentic-sdlc` ingest guidance corrected for explicit upsert.** The guide and the
  ingest-agent prompt now describe syncing accurately: re-ingesting an unchanged item
  returns it as-is (`created: false`), and propagating **edited** source requires
  `upsert: true` — a plain re-create returns the existing item unchanged rather than
  applying the edit. Pick stable `externalId`s and re-ingest with `upsert` to keep the
  knowledge base in sync; a from-scratch rebuild into an empty context is unaffected.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-06-28

### Added

- New bundled blueprint **`agentic-sdlc`** — a whole-SDLC system of
  record for an AI development team, organized by **content vs structure**. Nine
  schemas: ADRs (`decision`), `design`/specs, `reference`, `runbook`, and
  `postmortem` bind the **document** surface (the markdown body is the artifact);
  `control`, `convention`, `gotcha`, and a glossary `term` are **records** (the
  typed fields are the artifact). They form a **cross-surface knowledge graph** —
  records reference documents (`control` → the `runbook` that verifies it;
  `convention`/`term` → the `decision` behind them) and documents reference
  documents (a `design` → its `decision`, a `runbook` → the `postmortem` it was
  born from, an ADR → the one it supersedes). Shows hybrid search + grounded
  `rag_ask` over document bodies, range/sort on every artifact's date, a
  governance `control` that carries its evidence, a `convention` with distinct
  rule/why/howToApply fields, and a glossary `term` with a `unique` lookup. Ships
  without bundled seeds (the cross-surface graph is populated by the ingest agent).
- Usage guide (`guides/agentic-sdlc.md`) and drop-in agent orientation prompt
  (`prompts/agentic-sdlc-agent.md`) shipped with the package.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Document seeds.** A seed entry now declares a **surface**: `surface: record`
  (a structured record — the existing behavior) or `surface: document` (a
  text-ingested document carrying a `title` and `text`, with optional structured
  `fields`). A blueprint can now pre-populate documents, not just records, and
  model a **cross-surface graph** — a record's `reference` can target a seeded
  document by `externalId`, and vice versa. A seed's surface is validated against
  the bound schema's `allowedSurfaces`.

### Changed

- **Breaking (format):** every seed entry must now declare `surface`. Existing
  record seeds add `surface: record`. The discriminator is explicit by design — a
  document seed's first-class `title`/`text` are distinct from a record's
  `fields`, so the two shapes are validated separately.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-20

Initial public release of the Vectros blueprints library.

### Added

- Curated, ready-to-apply use-case blueprints — each bundling a schema set, a
  least-privilege AccessProfile, and seed data: `task-management`,
  `coding-agent-memory`, `second-brain`, and `clinical-intake`.
- The Blueprint format and a structural validation API for authoring your own —
  including field validation, render hints, sensitive (PHI) fields, typed
  `reference` links between record types, and the lookup-index surface (equality
  and ordered range/prefix lookups, the 7-slot budget, and uniqueness).
